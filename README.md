###About MyFood
MyFood is a personal project of mine that can track the food I am eating and how I am feeling after that food. As an active and health conscious person, I have always been interested in what foods are best for me personally, but it can be very difficult to mentally keep track of trends with specific foods. I therefore developed MyFood to keep track of all of this for me and allow me to see trends in how certain foods make me feel. This is an ongoing project that is not yet done, but feel free to play around with it!
